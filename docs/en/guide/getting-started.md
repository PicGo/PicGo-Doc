1. You can directly drag and drop images to the mini window for uploading.
2. Copy the image to the clipboard, then right click on the mini window and select `clipboard image upload` ( **You are not allowed to copy the image itself in systems other than macOS, e.g. Windows must open the image and copy by right-clicking. In the normal case, you want to directly upload your image once you have a snipshot. That is the rationality of this design.** ）

## Top Bar Upload

::: tip
Top bar upload is only supported in MacOS.
:::

1. You can drag and drop images to the PicGo icon in the top bar for uploading.
2. You can copy the image to the clipboard, then click on the PicGo icon in the top bar, click the image in `wait to upload` area, then the image will automatically upload.
